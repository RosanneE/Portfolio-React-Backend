    "bio": "Hello, I'm Rosanne, a Software Engineer based in Baltimore, MD. I graduated from General Assembly's Software Engineering boot camp July of 2022, and am currently job hunting, experimenting with what I've learned, and building up new skills. I'm a quick learner who enjoys a challenge and I can't wait to see where coding leads me.  Outside of coding, I like collecting hobbies. I've been swing dancing for over a decade, and know most ballroom and latin dances, I play piano and ukulele, rock climb, sketch, paint, learned some aerial silks, lira, and trapeze, playing Starcraft, Don't Starve, and DOTA, and about a million other things. I think the best way to keep your brain agile is to practice doing things you are bad at. On slow days, I enjoy yoga, reading a good book, and taking long walks with my puppy."
